# üßê About Youtube Downloader

With this module you can download videos and song from Youtube (MP3 and MP4) which allows from a specific YouTube video to convert to MP3 (Only audio) or MP4 (Video), and stored on disk.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running

### Basic example

A basic usage example to download mp3 is the following:

```javascript
const YTDL = require("@yohancolla/ytdl");

//Configure YoutubeDownloader with your settings
var ytdl = new YTDL({
    "outputPath": "/path/to/mp3/folder",    // Output file location (default: the home directory)  
    "queueParallelism": 2,                  // Download parallelism (default: 1)
    "progressTimeout": 2000,                // Interval in ms for the progress reports (default: 1000)
    "deleteTimeout": 60                     // Interval in seconds for delete the file (default: 0 [no delete])
});

//Download video and save as MP3 file
// On video quality default is highestaudio
ytdl.toMp3("https://youtu.be/CqGOwGQtCFk?si=8HSNkZBnjXrHx7Wp", "highestaudio");

ytdl.on("finish", function(err, data) {
    console.log(data);
});

ytdl.on("error", function(error) {
    console.log(error);
});

ytdl.on("progress", function(progress) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(progress));
});
```

You can also pass a file name for the respective video, which will then be used. Otherwise, the file name will be derived from the video title.
```javascript
ytdl.toMp3(linkURL, "highestaudio", "DVRST - My Toy");
```

While downloading, every `progressTimeout` timeframe, there will be an `progress` event triggered, outputting an object like

```javascript
{
    "videoId": "Vhd6Kc4TZls",
    "progress": {
        "percentage": 72.29996914191304,
        "transferred": 19559221,
        "length": 27052876,
        "remaining": 7493655,
        "eta": 2,
        "runtime": 6,
        "delta": 6591454,
        "speed": 3009110.923076923
    }
}
```

Furthermore, there will be a `queueSize` event emitted when the queue size changes (both positive and negative). This can be caught via

```javascript
ytdl.on("queueSize", function(size) {
    console.log(size);
});
```

Upon finish, the following output will be returned:

```javascript
{
    videoId: "Vhd6Kc4TZls",
    author: {
        artist: "DVRST",
        title: "My Toy",
        thumbnail: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vhd6Kc4TZls/hqdefault.jpg"
    }
    output: "/path/to/mp3/folder/DVRST - My Toy.mp3",
    videoTitle: "DVRST - My Toy"
}
```
